# Context
Preparation is key, and it works for DFIR too !
Being prepare means that you'll be able to concentrate on what you have to do instead of being lost.

# Prepare your tools
Before anything happen, you should have : 
- Tools for Windows AND Linux that respect the minimal imprint and integrity of collections (see [[Acquisition]])
- Playbooks and operational procedures to cover most of the uses cases
- Tools in a remote media (USB key, ready to package `.zip` file, network share, web host, ...) ready to deploy
- Backups that have been tested
