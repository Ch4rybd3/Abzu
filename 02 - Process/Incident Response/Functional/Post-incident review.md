# Context
When an incident ends, you should not just put the report on a shelf and forget about it.
This is a golden occasion to reinforce your toolbox, processes and see what you could have done better.

# What didn't worked
You should start by taking into account what didn't worked : 
- It could be missing training, not being used to a technique, not having the technical knowledge about a platform, ...
- It could be about the tools, some not being configured well, some that would not work because of the version, some that has limitations that were blocking, not having tools for the right platform + artifact, ...
- It could have been the processes too, overly complicated playbooks or missing important steps, no training in team, unclear decision making and priority order
- It could also have been the detection, was if not effective enough, do we had access to the datasource we needed, did we even saw the detection and badly categorized it due to alert exhaustion ? 

# What worked
It is also important to remember what worked well, because theses are points you should not forget about, you should engrave those points in your next incident and reinforce your posture.
Do something you did was useful and not documented ? did you use a tool that seems better than the one you're used to ? ...

# What we should do now
Based on the 2 previous point, you should be able to establish a list of upgrades for your tools, processes, ...
It could be : 
- A tool to add in your toolbox
- An update to a playbook
- A simplification of a playbook that is too much complex
- An alerting process that is inefficient.
