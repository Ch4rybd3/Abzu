# Context
When a user use powershell, every command that he input is stored in an history file, allowing us to identify the user behavior and suspicious `manual` commands that he entered.
Commands ran by a script aren't stored, since it only concern commands started manually in a console.
For powershell commands executed from scripts, refer to the [[EVTX]] log files.
